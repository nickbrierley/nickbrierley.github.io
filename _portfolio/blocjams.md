## Explanation

This is the first project that I did for bloc. I fist did it in normal javascript then I used jquery then finally I refactored it in angular.

## Problem

I built this up from the ground, and there are still some features that I will be adding. I will add in the ability to easily add in your own album, get it to dynamically show them on the collection page and finally I want  to refactor it to work on smart watches.

## Solution

I will fill this out more when I have solved all the problems. Some will be simple but others will be more difficult, but i'm sure that with some googleing I can figure it all out.

## Results

Once again I will fill this out more when I can. The site is at a very basic point right now but can become so much more.

## Conclusion

I will put more time into this at some point to make it better. I am excited to see it as a smartwatch app.
