title: My Biggest Challenge
---
The biggest challenge that I face as a growing developer is one that I assume plagues many others in the same boat as me. Taking what I learn and translating that into some actual web page or app without any guidence. I haven't had too much practice with that but I am beginning to get a taste of it as I work on the bloc chat webpage. It offers much less guidence so I am able to stretch my fingers and implement on my own what I have been learning. It offers a challange at the begining but once I get on a roll and with google I will be able to make a full web page.
