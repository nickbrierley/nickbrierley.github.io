title: My Experence with Bloc
---
Bloc has been a good experence so far. I am enjoying that I have a mentor that I can go to when I get stuck. The other good thing about having  a mentor is a having a bit more accountability for getting through the coding. When laziness gets me I know that I have to push through it and get back to work so I have more to show when I meet for the weekly meetings. Overall I am enjoying what I am learning and I look forward to learning much more.
